Node / NPM

Upgrade Node:
    1. sudo npm cache clean          -f (force) clear you npm cache
    2. sudo npm install -g n         install n (this might take a while)
    *3. sudo n stable                upgrade to the current stable version


* stable can be exchanged for latest, lts (long term support) or any specific version number such as 0.10.20.

If the version number doesn't show up when typing node -v, you might have to reboot.
